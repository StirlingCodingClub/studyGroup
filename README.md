## What we're about

*	Stirling Coding Club is fun, informal meetups of friends and colleagues to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and exploring open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

*	R topics will be posted here fortnightly. An in person meeting in room 4U5 every second Wednesday at 12 noon will introduce a new topic / challenge.

*	Everyone is welcome to suggest topics, create lessons / challenges / ask questions / make changes to website and events.

*	If you're interested in starting a group of your own, you can check out the Study Group Repository on GitHub or our Study Group Orientation Guide.
